### Self Driving Car using Genetic Algorithms
In this project we train a car to drive using genetic algorithms. The car and world is created using Unity. Click the thumbnail below to watch a video of a trained car in action:

### Details
The car uses sensors to register the distance to the walls. These inputs are fed into a neural network that decides what direction the steering wheel should take, and how much gas to give. The genetic algorithms uses the weights of the neural network as genetic material.
